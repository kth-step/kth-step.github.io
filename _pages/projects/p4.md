Software-Defined Networking (SDN) permits programming the data plane of
the network devices using languages such as P4. This capability can impact
network correctness due to error-prone programs. To address this, we have
built a formalization of P4 semantics using the interactive theorem prover
HOL4. This semantics allows us to analyse security properties in P4 packet
forwarding programs.
